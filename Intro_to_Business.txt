A description of the problem and a discussion of the background:
We will be looking for the best place to open a SoulCycle class in Bratislava, Slovakia. This is an idea that I've been having in my head for a long time. Since we don't have this type of fitness class in Slovakia yet, I will want to bring this idea from abroad here. Bratislava is a very modern and vibrant city with a majority of young population and people wanting to live very healthy. The idea of having SoulCycle in Bratislava thrills me as I believe it will be very successful here. I also believe that this will be very popular among women who like to take care of their body and workout on regular basis. Fitness classes have started growing in popularity over the past few years and I firmly believe that bringing an American phenomenon into Slovakia will be a success due to young population being influenced by the Western culture. 

A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem:
We will use Foursquare to see the density of fitness classes/gyms in Bratislava and to find the most suitable place to position our business. The data would be also used to see what good services are also around, such as healthy restaurants so that people can grab something to eat after a SoulCycle class. To solve the problem, we will see what is the best location/ part of Bratislava to open the business.
